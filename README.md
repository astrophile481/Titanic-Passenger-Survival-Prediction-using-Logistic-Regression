# Titanic-Passenger-Survival-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
Predict Titanic passenger survival using logistic regression. Achieves 78% accuracy on provided dataset. Great for binary classification beginners.

This Github repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the famous Titanic dataset, including exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques. The project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using a logistic regression model. The model uses several features such as age, sex, passenger class, and embarkation point to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

The project provides a detailed step-by-step explanation of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. The model achieved an accuracy of 78% on the provided dataset, and the classification report is included in the repository.

This project serves as a great introduction to binary classification problems and provides a hands-on approach to data preprocessing and model selection. The code is well documented and organized, making it easy to follow and understand. It can be used as a starting point for more complex models, or as a reference for those new to machine learning.
